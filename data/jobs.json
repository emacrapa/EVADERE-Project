      "contacts": ["francesco.peri@unimib.it", "alessio.romerio@unimib.it"],
      "objectives": "Training in organic and medicinal chemistry. The project is aimed at the identification of new small molecule agonists of human innate immune receptors acting as vaccine adjuvants and novel glycans (including glycan mimetics) as bacterial antigens. The DC will benefit from UNIMIB’s multidisciplinary experience in rational design and synthesis of small organic molecules with immunomodulating activity. The DC will be trained to computer-assisted drug design; docking with the target receptor(s); organic synthesis; interpretation of MS and NMR spectra; purification techniques; assessment of purity of final compounds for biological tests",
      "expected_results": "New small-molecules active on innate immunity receptors (particularly Toll-Like Receptors, TLRs) and molecules reproducing glycan-based bacterial antigens will be rationally designed and synthesized. The medicinal chemistry approach to TLR4 modulation developed in UNIMB allowed the recent development of several efficacious drug candidates with activity in inhibiting or stimulating human innate immunity. The structural data available in the consortium will allow the design of glycans and glycan mimetics as new antigens to be used in vaccine formulation. Collaboration with other beneficiaries in developing new adjuvants also based on different targets than TLR4; glycan-based adjuvants (in collaboration with Croda, Denmark and Imperial College, London); conjugation techniques. Planned secondments in a company specialized in synthesis of glycan-containing adjuvants (Carbohyde, Budapest, Hungary;) at the Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) for conjugation techniques and glycan synthesis.",

      "objectives": "Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are bacterial pathogens that are responsible for life-threatening antimicrobial resistant infections. They are classified by the WHO as “Critical” and “High” priority pathogens for which new treatments or vaccines are desperately needed. The UCD EVADERE team have identified several vaccine candidates that are protective against these infections in preclinical models. In order to progress these promising candidates to human trials, the mechanisms by which they provide immunoprotection need to be elucidated. This project will focus on lead UCD vaccine antigens that are most protective against K. pneumoniae or P. aeruginosa with the aim of understanding their immune correlates of protection. The cellular and humoral immune responses that the antigens elicit will be comprehensively profiled individually and as multivalent vaccines, by flow cytometry, ELISpot and other methods. The impact of adjuvants (both established and novel) on their protective responses will also be investigated in vitro and in vivo. Optimised combinations of antigens and adjuvants will be examined for their potential to protect mice against bacterial acute pneumonia challenge.",

The DC will benefit from CNR-IBB multidisciplinary experience in structural biology. The DC will be trained in recombinant techniques, high throughput purification, x-ray crystallography, biophysics and biochemistry, molecular modelling and docking, immunobioinformatics. The DC will adopt a structural vaccinology approach to combine information from immunology assays with structural data and achieve antigen epitope mapping. This information will be used to re-design vaccine antigens with selective enhancement of antigenicity and to design cross- protective antigens against multiple bacterial species. The DC will have access to top-level molecular and structural biology platforms (and synchrotrons) in Europe.",
